# About_Me_
Contains a short profile README to discuss my interests, skills and background

I’m Dr Vimbai Matshalaga, a Zimbabwean medical doctor and Junior Resident Medical Officer with a strong interest in how technology, data and AI can advance equitable, patient‑centred care. I work at the intersection of clinical medicine and public health, with a focus on improving health outcomes for diverse and underserved communities.

My clinical work is grounded in evidence‑based practice, cultural humility and inclusive care for patients from different backgrounds. I’m particularly interested in health equity, health systems strengthening and how ethical, privacy‑conscious digital tools can support clinicians and reduce disparities in access and quality of care.

On the technical side, I’m building skills in health data analysis, AI in healthcare and digital health innovation. I enjoy collaborating in multidisciplinary teams, translating between medical, technical and policy perspectives, and exploring ways to integrate technology into real clinical workflows without losing the human element of care.

Long term, I’m motivated by the vision of global health systems that are technologically enabled yet deeply people‑centred. On this GitHub, I use projects to document that journey, experimenting with data, incorporating my experiences, exploring responsible AI applications in health, and showcasing how clinical insight can shape meaningful public and digital health solutions.
